        <h2> What is Project Zero Fin-vasion? </h2>
        <p> A three-phase project that involves conducting baseline research and data gathering 
            to monitor and assess the current state of freshwater invasive species using GRIIS, 
            working with riverside communities and local fisherfolk through discussions, seminars, 
            and workshops to raise awareness on IAS, and formally proposing a budget increase for 
            organizations such as DENR and BFAR for research and development on more effective and 
            technologically advanced solutions for this problem. </p>

        <h2> Mission </h2>
        <p> Project Zero Fin-vasion is committed to protecting freshwater ecosystems from invasive 
            alien species (IAS) through scientific research, community engagement, and policy 
            advocacy. By fostering awareness, equipping local stakeholders, and pushing for 
            sustainable and technologically advanced solutions, we aim to mitigate the impact 
            of IAS and prevent further introduction, safeguard native biodiversity, and 
            promote responsible resource management for the benefit of the present and future of 
            humankind and environment. </p>

        <h2> Vision </h2>
        <p> This advocacy envisions a future where freshwater ecosystems in the Philippines thrive 
            free from the threats of invasive species, ensuring ecological balance, sustainable 
            fisheries, and improved livelihoods for local communities. Through proactive conservation 
            efforts, technological advancements, and collaborative action, we strive to support the 
            global mission of SDG 14 of preserving and protecting life below water for a healthier 
            and more sustainable planet. </p>
